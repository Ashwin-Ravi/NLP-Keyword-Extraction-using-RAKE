# NLP-Keyword-Extraction-using-RAKE

The script uses RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) to obtain top keywords in Reddit posts. 
Providing an approximation of the trending topics and words in a given link. 
I have modified the RAKE algorithm such that it considers keywords only if they are repeated more that a certain number of times,
have more that specified characters and are lesser than a certain number of words.
These numbers are parameterised and given as inputs to the RAKE algorithm
